My expertise lies in systems design and software development. I've focused heavily on creating maintainable code, reducing the developer friction during onboarding and during every-day feature development and bugfixing.
 I've broken apart monoliths into microservices and consolidated fractured projects into unified codebases. I've created massive API's with third party integrations designed to scale with business needs, while also creating endpoints for a better end-user experience.
 This drive to ensure that the developer experience is clean and easy is one of my main goals as an engineer, ensuring that the code that we write is maintainable and understandable not just in the present, but going on into the future.
